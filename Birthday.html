                    The past three months have been an unforgettable part of my journey — full of smiles, laughter, and
                    memories that I will always hold close to my heart. On your birthday today, I want to celebrate
                    you🎉 — your kindness, your happiness, and the light you bring into every moment.

                    I wish I could be by your side to celebrate in person, but even though I can’t, please know that my
                    thoughts are with you every second of this day. I hope this little gift — a website made just for
                    you — brings some joy and shows you how much you mean to me.

                    May this year bring you endless happiness, good health, success in your studies, and every dream of
                    yours coming closer to reality. 🌸 You deserve all the wonderful things the world has to
                    offer.🫶❤️‍🔥</p>

                    I’m really sorry that I can’t be with you in person for your birthday this year. I wish I could
                    celebrate with you, bring you gifts, and make you smile face-to-face — but my exams keep me away.
                    Please forgive me for not being able to be there.

                    Even though we are apart, I want you to know that you are always in my thoughts. You are important
                    to me, and I care deeply for you.
